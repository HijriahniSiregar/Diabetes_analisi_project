# 🩺 Health Data Analysis: Diabetes Risk Factors

This dataset contains health-related data used to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes (`Outcome`: 1 = diabetes, 0 = no diabetes). The following features are included:

- **Pregnancies** – Number of times pregnant.
- **Glucose** – Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL).
- **BloodPressure** – Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness** – Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin** – Serum insulin level (mu U/ml).
- **BMI** – Body Mass Index (weight/height²).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction** – A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age** – Age in years.
- **Outcome** – 1 = Positive for diabetes, 0 = Negative for diabetes.

## 📊 Key Insights

Comparison of individuals with diabetes and those without reveals:

| Factor            | Mean (Diabetic) | Mean (Non-Diabetic) |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Age**           | 37 years        | 31 years            |
| **BMI**           | 35.14           | 30.30               |
| **Glucose**       | 141.26          | 109.98              |
| **Blood Pressure**| 70.82           | 68.18               |

- Higher **age**, **BMI**, and **glucose levels** are strongly associated with diabetes.
- Blood pressure is slightly higher among diabetic individuals but not significantly different.

## 🛡️ Recommendations to Reduce Risk of Diabetes and Hypertension

1. **Maintain a Healthy Weight (BMI 18.5–24.9)**  
   Engage in regular physical activity and reduce processed carbohydrate and sugar intake.

2. **Adopt a Balanced Diet**  
   Prioritize vegetables, low-sugar fruits, whole grains, and lean protein. Avoid trans fats and saturated fats.

3. **Monitor Blood Glucose and Pressure Regularly**  
   Especially important for individuals with a family history of diabetes.

4. **Manage Stress and Get Enough Sleep**  
   Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep and practice stress-relief techniques such as meditation.

5. **Avoid Smoking and Limit Alcohol**  
   Both are known contributors to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
